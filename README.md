# Car Hacking IDS

## Objective
This study is to develop the best model for IDS based to detect attacks in CAN Bus.

I used and analyzed the deep learning-based IDS, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and optimizing it with transfer learning, and ensemble learning, this method proposed by Li Yang and Abdallah Shami. The models contained in this study are VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionResnet, and Inception for training on vehicle network traffic data.

I also implemented a different approach using classical models KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree for KIA Soul datasets which was proposed by Bifta Sama Bari, Kumar Yelamarthi, and Sheikh Ghafoor.

## Datasets
- The first dataset is car hacking which was developed by Huy Kang Kim: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset
- The other one is KIA Soul datasets: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/datachallenge2019/car
