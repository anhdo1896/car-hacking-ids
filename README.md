# Car Hacking IDS

## Objective
This study is to develop the best model for IDS based to detect attacks in CAN Bus.

Analyzed the deep learning-based IDS, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) proposed by Li Yang and Abdallah Shami. 

Implemented a different approach using classical models KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree for KIA Soul datasets by Bifta Sama Bari, Kumar Yelamarthi, and Sheikh Ghafoor.

## Datasets
- The first dataset is car hacking which was developed by Huy Kang Kim: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/car-hacking-dataset
- The other one is KIA Soul datasets: https://ocslab.hksecurity.net/Datasets/datachallenge2019/car
